FINDINGS

The Board makes the following findings regarding the Property at 2070 Glen Way

residents parking their vehicles in the driveway. This, however, allowed non-

residents to enter the Property. This is a situation that took place per the

Petitioner. The gate should have been closed when not in immediate use as it
compromised security for the residents.

2. The Board finds that while the Petitioner cites cloudy and discolored water as a
basis for a rent refund, the Respondent had informed the Petitioner that the water
was cloudy from the water supplier. The Respondent also had a vendor test the

water. The vendor found the water was safe to drink.

IV. SCOPE OF REVIEW

The Rules and Regulations (hereinafter “Regulations”) of the Board provide the standard
of review for appeals before the Board. Per the Regulations, this Appeal is considered on the
administrative record submitted to the Hearing Examiner unless the Board decides to review the
Hearing Examiner’s decision de novo. Therefore, the Board shall disregard any evidence,
discussion or comment regarding factual matters that were not in the record before the Hearing
Examiner or officially noticed. (Regulations §1500.G.2.h.)

The parties may discuss or comment upon the legal matters in question or other pertinent
matters raised by the appeal. However, the parties may not include, in their discussion or
comments, factual matters or evidence that were not presented to the Hearing Examiner or
officially noticed. Documents and information not presented at the Hearing Examiner
proceeding cannot be included as part of the record on appeal and must be disregarded on appeal
as beyond the scope of appellate review.

The burden of proof is upon Appellant to establish there was either an error or abuse of
discretion on the part of the Hearing Examiner. (Regulations §1500.G.2.b.) The terms “error”
and “abuse of discretion” are not defined in the RSO. The Board adopts the meaning of “abuse
of discretion” as it is used in the context of judicial review of administrative decisions,

To establish that the Hearing Examiner abused his discretion, the Appellants must prove
that (a) the Hearing Examiner did not proceed in the manner required by law, (b) the decision is
not supported by the findings, or (c) the findings are not supported by the evidence. (Cal. Code
of Civ. Proc. §1094.5(b).)

Il. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Board makes the following conclusions of law:

A. Habitability Issues

In order to evaluate whether the Hearing Examiner erred or abused his discretion in
finding that the conditions violated the warranty of habitability, we must review the standards of
habitability.

1. State Law

State law provides guidance regarding the standards habitability. California Civil Code
section 1941.1 provides that if a dwelling unit lacks the following characteristic, then it is unfit
for human habitation: “[e]ffective waterproofing and weather protection of roof and exterior
walls, including unbroken windows and doors.” (Cal. Civ. Code § 1941.1 (a)(1).)

The California Supreme Court has concluded that a warranty of habitability is implied by
law in residential leases in California. (Green v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 10 Cal. 3d
616, 718-719.) Under the implied warranty, a residential landlord covenants that premises he
leases for living quarters will be maintained in a habitable state for the duration of the lease. (Id.)
The warranty of habitability does not require that a landlord ensure that leased premises are in
perfect, aesthetically pleasing condition, but it does mean that "bare living requirements" must be
maintained. (Id.)

2. Local Law

In East Palo Alto, a landlord’s failure to maintain a premise in habitable condition is
considered an increase in rent. (EPA Muni. Code § 14.04.130.) The Program Rules and
Regulations provide that the following are grounds for reductions in Rent or a rent rebate:

a. Failure to comply with the “Warranty of Habitability” set forth in California Civil
Code Sec. 1941.1 as it currently exists or is amended or interpreted in the future.

b. Failure to comply with building and housing codes or other legal requirements

for the maintenance and operation of rental housing which affect the livability and/or rental value
of the premises.

c. Decreases in Housing Services or failure to provide adequate maintenance without a
corresponding reduction in Rent.

VI. CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, the Board affirms in part and reverses in part the decision of the
Hearing Examiner as follows:
The Board affirms the following findings of the Hearing Examiner:
1. The Property is subject to the RSO and no exemption was applicable at the time the
Hearing Examiner made his determination. !
2. The Appellee did not meet the burden of proof that the water supplied to the
Property was not safe for use and so no rent refund will be issued.
The Board reverses in part the following finding of the Hearing Examiner:
3. That Petitioner failed to meet his/her burden of a violation of the warranty of
habitability security reasons. Appellants must pay Appellee an additional $230 due

to the main security gate being left open allowing non-residents onto the property.

The Board find the Appellants are to pay the Appellee a total amount of $460, $230 for the main

security gate and $230 for the ant infestation approved in the original petition.

SO ORDERED.

DATED: January 18, 2023 RENT STABILIZATION BOARD

' Although appellant contends that the Hearing Examiner failed to note the implications of a failure to register rental
units, this is not a cognizable basis for appeal.
